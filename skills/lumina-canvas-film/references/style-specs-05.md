# Complete style specifications 05


<!-- STYLE: teardown -->

| Move | What it expresses | Can serve |
|---|---|---|
| Orbit while layers separate | the whole, its order of assembly | a reveal; a structure overview |
| Grazing macro dolly | touch, material, finish | an opening; a texture |
| Dive between layers | being inside | a hidden component; how it works |
| Slow push on one still part | the part that matters | a chip, a sensor, a seal |
| Rise through the stack | one subsystem to the next | a transition between stops |
| Fast pull back | return, synthesis | a closing; a before/after |
| High three-quarter drift | scale and precision | sizes, pitch, thickness |

- At key moments the subject fills at least a third of the frame height. Labels live in a column on the free side (shift the projection with a view offset rather than moving the object), subtitles in the bottom 12 %.
- Transitions are camera moves through the object itself. No cuts to black, no slide transitions, no split screens.
- The camera path is keyed in the product's own coordinates and interpolated without overshoot (monotone cubic), so a held macro really holds.

## 7. Sound palette

- Instruments: tuned mallets (marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, glass), a round bass, a short synthetic kick and small dry percussion. Precise and dry outside the object; sustained and airy inside it.
- Foley is the material: hollow plastic clacks for keycaps or housings, a switch click with a low thock, dry taps for boards, inharmonic rings for small machined metal, a soft thud for the enclosure, airy swooshes for layers lifting and for camera dives, a fine pen hiss when a dimension line draws, a tiny tick per label.
- Every separation and every landing has its sound, panned to where the part is.
- Silence: at least two near-silences (room tone only) before the big separations or the turn back; the first sound after each is the most important hit around it.
- Mix: voice clearly on top (music about 10 dB under it while it speaks), music bus ducked, sub-bass kept lean (20–60 Hz well under the full band), loudness −14 LUFS.
- Voice: calm, close, unhurried, short sentences; numbers spoken as words, written as digits.

## 8. Native moves

- **The wave lift.** Repeated parts rise in a wave across the object. *Fits content like:* battery cells; solar tiles; the drawers of a modular shelf.
- **Inside the gap.** The camera enters the space between two lifted layers to see a hidden face. *Fits content like:* the back of a logic board; the inside of a drone arm; the underside of a sensor module.
- **The leader that lands on the part.** A macro label whose line ends on the component. *Fits content like:* a pressure sensor in a shoe; a gasket in a waterproof case; a motor driver.
- **Dimensions drawn on the thing.** After closing, the real outline gets dimension lines in perspective. *Fits content like:* the thickness of a laptop lid; the footprint of a router; the bore of a valve.
- **One real motion.** A part performs its true mechanical motion once (a press, a hinge, a latch). *Fits content like:* a camera shutter; a buckle; a folding hinge.
- **Lights on inside.** Emitters inside the product switch on while it is apart. *Fits content like:* status LEDs; a backlit display; an indicator ring.

## 9. Pitfalls of the medium

- **Invented numbers.** A size that no file gives. Fix: measure it from the CAD and say "measured" in the facts file, or leave it out.
- **Mixed-up revisions.** Plates, cases and boards from different versions of a project. Fix: check hole positions and stack heights across the files (they must coincide), and pin the commit.
- **Panelised boards.** Layout files may hold a panel with breakaway tabs. Fix: take the outline from a plate or case of the same revision, or flood-fill from an interior point.
- **Zero-length edges.** Duplicate outline points give zero normals → NaN → black squares after bloom. Fix: clean outlines, repair zero normals, scan frames for one-frame black tiles.
- **Overshooting camera splines.** Catmull-Rom over unevenly spaced keys flies past a macro stop. Fix: monotone interpolation per component.
- **Labels too short.** Macro stops last about three seconds. Fix: one fact per label, opened before the camera settles; check with `readcheck`.
- **Over-bright light sweeps.** Area lights blow plastics to white. Fix: sweeps at a fraction of the key, bloom threshold above the brightest diffuse surface.
- **Brand marks on parts.** Chip tops and connector shells carry trademarks. Fix: plain package tops; drop logo footprints unless the product is the user's own.
- **Crushed blacks.** Black plastics against a black ground disappear. Fix: lift them to a dark grey and let the rim light separate them.

## 10. Engine

All in `demo/src/` (three.js r170, the library's `core/three/post.js` and `core/lib.js`):

- `parts.js`: `keycapGeometry(w, d, h)` (lofted shell with a spherical dish and a stem), `switchGeometries()`, `loft(rings)`, `shapeFrom(outline, holes, circles)` (KiCad outline to extrusion), `inset`, `hexSpacer`, `screwGeometry`.
- `pcbtex.js`: `paintPCB(data, side, outline, box, ppm)` paints colour, roughness/metalness and bump maps from extracted layout data.
- `comps.js`: `buildBackParts(data, group, y, materials)` places package bodies at footprint positions and returns anchors.
- `overlay.js`: anchored labels (`label`), perspective dimension lines (`dimension`), subtitles, title card, readcheck texts, subtitle width check.
- `main.js`: layers, explode and gap functions, the camera keys (orbit or eye/target, monotone), lights, `window.EV` for the mixer.
- `tools/extract_pcb.py`, `kicad_geom.py`, `sexp.py`: read any `.kicad_pcb` (outlines, tracks, zones, pads, silkscreen, footprints; plain Python). `tools/step2mesh.mjs`: STEP to mesh.

**Extra packages and packs**, beyond `setup.sh deps [voice] [music]`: `occt-import-js` (npm, LGPL-2.1, not in the library's package.json) to triangulate STEP files, and the studio HDRI (`sh tools/fetch.sh hdri`). Install the npm package yourself into a private `node_modules` in the project folder (as `tools/fetch_cad.sh` does in a temp folder), never into `$LIB`.

Minimal example, not in the demo: read a plate file with `extract_pcb.py`, extrude `shapeFrom(outline, cutouts)` 1.5 mm as aluminium (`metalness: 1, roughness: .35`) and orbit it with three `CAM` keys.

## 11. Variation space

Decided per film: which product and revision, which layers to separate and in what order, how many stops inside and which parts deserve them, the camera route, whether to open from the whole or from a detail, the product's palette and the accent, the voice.

- **Three structures**: one orbit with two stops; a "how it works" path following a signal or flow through the layers; two revisions taken apart side by side, each held still before a difference is named.
- **Three openings**: a part performing its real motion in macro; the closed product turning in silence on the seamless; a single component floating alone before the rest of the product assembles around it.
- **Three endings**: closed with its dimensions drawn on it; closing into a top view that becomes a technical drawing; apart one last time, frozen, every part labelled like a printable sheet.

# Microscope Story — Style Prompt

> Real, licence-clean microscopy of a real specimen, seen as it is, and one continuous change of scale that carries the viewer from the glass slide in the hand to a single cell. Focus breathes when the magnification changes, a focal plane sweeps when the camera lands, and every scale bar, field of view and reading comes from the image's own metadata.
> References (grammar only): Charles and Ray Eames' *Powers of Ten* (one continuous change of scale with a readout riding along); premium microscope launch films (dark bench, glass catching light, restrained marks, clean instrument sound); digital-pathology viewers' instruments (scale bar, field of view, magnification). Copy none of their layouts, interfaces, typefaces or music; never name them in the film.

## 1. Essence, and what it is not

- **The specimen is a photograph**: a real micrograph or whole-slide scan of the actual sample, CC0, public domain or CC BY. Nothing on the specimen is drawn, retouched or generated. A whole-slide image (WSI) is the ideal source: one sample, one registered pyramid from millimetres to microns, with the pixel size in its metadata.
- **Scale is the camera**: one log-space dive (and, when the story wants it, the climb back) through nested plates of the same sample. The scale bar shortens and jumps in a 1-2-5 sequence, the field-of-view readout rolls, the magnification steps.
- **Focus has a grammar**: a rack-in from soft at the start, a short breath (blur + a hint of field change) each time the magnification changes, a focal-plane sweep across the frame when the camera lands.
- **Readings are measured**: every number is computed from the file (pixel size × pixels) and the screen says how it was measured. Describe what was measured; never diagnose. Keep a `FACTS.md` in the project folder (claim, source URL, quoted wording, or the measurement method) and deliver it with the film.
- **One reading per screen**, in the single accent colour.

Not Satellite Briefing (no grey grade; the stain keeps its colour), not Sci-fi HUD (no glowing wireframes or crosshairs), not Data Storytelling (no chart paper), not a keynote (no slides or header bars).

## 2. Materials & rendering

- **Plates**: the WSI pyramid levels as plates in one world frame (level-0 pixels), the coarse levels whole and alpha-feathered at the scan edge, the fine levels as crops around where the camera lands. Each frame draws the finest plate that is downsampled no more than ~1.45×, and blends the next level in between 2.2× and 1.45×: no seams and no visible upsampling, because every level is the same sample, already registered.
- **The naked-eye plate**: the scanner's own photo of the whole slide (many WSI files carry one), registered through the scan's area-of-interest metadata and checked against the tissue's centroid. Cut the glass out of the scanner tray, remove the line-sensor streaks, and fill any manufacturer's printed logo with the surrounding frosted glass. Below ~30 mm of field the photo would be upsampled: let the cover glass become clean glass (its dust leaves the focal plane).
- **One grade for every plate**: glass normalised to a warm white, a little density and chroma in the stain, nothing else. No false colour, no film emulation.
- **The bench**: graphite under a slow pool of light; a soft shadow under the slide.
- **Focus**: screen-space Gaussian blur on a frame rendered with a margin (so edges never go dark); the focal sweep is a tilted sharp front crossing a softened frame. A light illumination vignette, nothing more.
- **Marks** in screen space but anchored to the specimen through one world → screen function: hairlines 1.5–2.5 px with a dark or light halo, circles drawn on as arcs with cardinal ticks, dimension lines with end ticks, leader lines with one elbow. Counted pixels are shown as a mask revealed behind a scan front, then kept as a faint trace.
- **Frosted panels** (dark translucent glass over a blurred copy of the frame) for readings, instruments, subtitles and the credit: white type reads on glass and stain alike, nothing switches colour mid-shot.

## 3. Colour logic

- Glass: warm paper white. Bench: graphite. The stain is evidence and keeps its true colour (e.g. trichrome red and blue, H&E pink and purple).
- One accent, cool and away from the stain's hues (mint against red and blue; amber against a green or purple stain), only for the measured reading and the counted pixels.
- Ink on glass is near-black; type on stain sits on a frosted panel in warm white.

Example (our demo): glass #F4F1EC, bench #0B0D0F → #2A3036, ink #181B1F, panel rgba(12,14,17,0.74), accent mint rgb(120,240,205) (on stain) / rgb(0,122,99) (on glass).

## 4. Type & subtitles

- **Roles**: a light condensed grotesk for readings and the scale bar (40–72 px, e.g. Barlow Condensed); a monospace for instruments and pixel counts (20 px, e.g. IBM Plex Mono); a sans in the film's language for labels (20–34 px, e.g. Noto Sans SC); a serif only for the title. OFL, self-hosted, CJK subset.
- **Instruments** live in one frosted panel in a corner: scale bar with its value, field of view, magnification with a small nosepiece glyph that turns a quarter on every change. The source credit in a small panel in the opposite corner.
- **Readings** sit in a frosted panel beside what they measure, joined by a leader: a small label above ("collagen share of tissue area"), the number large in the accent, the method or the raw counts below.
- **Subtitles**: a frosted strip at the bottom; if the film is bilingual, one line per language with the film's language on top, never wrapped. Measure each line with the real font and split long lines into two cues.
- Nothing below 20 px at 1080p. Hold labels ≥ characters ÷ 4.5 + 1.5 s (CJK); a reading that rolls is reported by its landing value.

## 5. Motion quality

- The camera is a similarity transform (zoom, roll, position) interpolated as a log spiral between keys (M^u about the fixed point of the two frames), so every push is a true dive towards one point and the roll is part of it. Ease the moves, creep 2–5 % during holds; never a frozen frame longer than a second.
- Magnification changes happen where the plates actually change, each with a breath of focus, a turret click and the new magnification said once, large.
- Marks arrive by being made: a dimension line grows from its centre, a circle is drawn as an arc, a scan front counts pixels while the reading rolls, the reading lands with a small spring.
- Never moves: the specimen under its marks, the instrument positions.

## 6. Camera grammar

| Move | What it expresses | Can serve |
|---|---|---|
| The dive (log zoom with roll) | going to look for yourself | an opening; from the slide to the cell |
| Locked frame, slow creep | evidence, a measurement | a reading; a comparison |
| Truck at one magnification | a second sample of the same thing | the counter-example; "meanwhile, nearby" |
| Pull back to frame two marks | comparison | the verdict |
| Focal-plane sweep | arriving; depth | a landing; a reveal inside one frame |
| The climb (reverse dive, scale bar jumping back) | consequence, scale | an ending; a return to the eye's scale |

At key moments the measured structure fills a third of the frame height or more; instruments in a corner, subtitles bottom centre, readings beside their marks. Transitions are scale changes, trucks and focus, never cuts or crossfades between samples.

## 7. Sound palette

- **Instrument foley**: the objective turret (a click, a detent, a small metal ring), a focus servo, pen on glass for each line drawn, a band-passed scan travelling left to right with counter ticks that speed up, a soft filtered sweep for the focal plane.
- **Music**: hard-mallet vibraphone in 8ths and 16ths, marimba ticks, bowed vibraphone and water glasses for pads and the motif, glockenspiel for each reading that lands, a pulse bass with 2nd/3rd harmonics, timpani and bass drum under the landings. Harmony stays open and light; the score is the user's to shape.
- **Beds**: a quiet lab room (fan, a little mains hum).
- **Silence** before the verdict and before the climb; the first sound after it is the reading or the turn.
- **Mix**: voice ~10 dB over music, music ducked under it; −14 LUFS. Voice: a calm, exact narrator; numbers spelled out for the TTS, digits on screen.

## 8. Native moves

- **The dive.** From the slide in the hand to a cell in one camera, the turret clicking at each real change of level. *Fits content like:* a biopsy to its cells; a coated surface to its crystals; a hair or skin section to its layers.
- **Counting the colour.** Draw a circle, let a scan front cross it, light up every counted pixel and roll the share up to its landing value; show the raw counts underneath. *Fits content like:* collagen in tissue; porosity in a ceramic; coverage of a coating; pigment in a sample.
- **Two circles, one verdict.** Measure one place, truck to another at the same scale, then frame both and say what differs. *Fits content like:* treated against untreated; edge against centre; before against after.
- **The focal sweep and the ring.** Land, sweep the focal plane across the frame, ring one structure and give its size. *Fits content like:* a nucleus; a grain; a fibre's diameter.
- **The climb back.** Pull out to the eye's scale with the scale bar jumping backwards; a title card written on the glass.

## 9. Pitfalls of the medium

- **Licences**: most microscopy on the web is CC BY-NC or all rights reserved. Usable: CC0 whole-slide scans (e.g. the OpenSlide test data: check each file's licence line), public-domain government micrographs (NIH, CDC PHIL, NASA, USGS), CC BY collections (Cell Image Library, Wellcome Collection), with every file listed in `CREDITS`. Not usable: CC BY-SA without agreement, NC images, journal figures, AI images.
- **Finding material for a new topic**: search by organ, stain or material plus "whole slide" in the OpenSlide test data, NCI Imaging Data Commons (TCGA/CPTAC slides, licence per collection), the Cell Image Library, Wellcome Collection, Wikimedia Commons (filter by licence) and NIH/CDC galleries; prefer a file whose metadata carries its pixel size. CC BY-SA, ODbL or "no known restrictions" are not CC0: name the terms to the user and ask before using them. For a product, a lab or a brand, ask the user for their own scans (SVS/NDPI/MRXS, SEM TIFFs with a scale) first. Never stand in a generated image for a real specimen.
- **Different samples never zoom into each other**: two micrographs of "the same thing" at two scales are two specimens. Use one pyramid; if you must join sources, cut on a focus breath and say so.
- **Pixel size**: read it from the file (XMP `ScanRes`, TIFF resolution, OME `PhysicalSizeX`); a slide-photo's resolution tag can be trusted only after checking against the scan.
- **Upsampling** shows as mush beyond ~1.6×: end the dive at the scan's real resolution.
- **Tile seams**: some scanners overlap tiles; check the joint info, frame out visible seams.
- **Labels and logos** on the slide: barcodes and IDs are part of the object; manufacturer logos are not — fill or crop them.
- **Claims**: a stain's colour means what the stain protocol says, nothing more; measured shares are of the drawn region and the stated threshold, never a clinical score.
